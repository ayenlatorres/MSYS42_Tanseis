‼️STUFF THAT STILL NEEDS TO BE FIXED‼️
• Models for Education
• Edit Child Profile (currently, the fields only display the values but save button does not work. Some fields don't display values at all)
• View Child Profile html Does not include education yet
• Create child profile error handling is not uniform 
• style.css doesnt work (idk why not)

- Search Field does not work
- Query Button does not work

2) Clicking Create Child Profile button should lead to Create Child profile page. This should follow the Use Case Description for UC 01.

3) Clicking View on a specific child profile will lead to View Profile Page
- Updated Nav Bar with Health buttons
